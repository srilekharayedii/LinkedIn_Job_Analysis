LinkedIn Job Search Analysis

Overview:

In today's dynamic job market, understanding the factors influencing salary levels is crucial for both job seekers and employers. This project aims to create a predictive model for salary estimation based on various job listing features using LinkedIn job posting data from Kaggle. The dataset includes details on company size, location, industry, job title, and necessary skills. The project involves pre-processing the data, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. Various machine learning techniques are applied to build a precise salary prediction model.

Project Goals:

1. Predictive Modelling: Utilize machine learning techniques to create a robust salary prediction model.
2. Informative Insights: Provide insightful information for job seekers and employers to make informed career decisions and salary offerings.
3. Data-driven Decision-making: Enable employers to attract top talent by benchmarking salary offerings using data-driven decision-making.
4. Open and Effective Labour Market: Bridge the information gap between employers and job seekers for a more open and effective labour market.

Project Components:

1. Data Exploration and Pre-processing: Analyse and clean the dataset, handle missing data, and pre-process features for modelling.
2. Feature Engineering: Develop new features and transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
3. Machine Learning Models: Implement various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, KNearestNeighbour, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and a simple deep learning model.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model through feature importance analysis, decision boundary exploration, and ensemble model examination.
5. Visualizations and Insights: Provide visuals and insights related to each model's benefits and capabilities, fostering a comprehensive understanding of their suitability for different types of data.

Repository Structure:

- data: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
